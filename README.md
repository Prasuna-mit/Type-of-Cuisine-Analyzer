# Analyzer

The tool we are going to implement in this project is an Analyzer. This project is related to prediction of type of cusine by taking the ingredients as input. 

## Getting Started

For this project, the dataset by yummly.com has been taken. This dataset is json format and have the list of dictionaries with three main keys and corresponding values. This project actually helps in setting menu better by predicting relevant cuisines based on the available ingredients.

### Prerequisites

Having very good understanding of python and hands on experience working with python packages and libraries help a lot.

### Installing

It is a simple yet interesting project. I implemeted this tool on python in jupyter platform. You can use other platforms like pyCharm or can work on terminal aswell. But make sure to install python latest version.
